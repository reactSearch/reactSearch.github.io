# ReactSearch

This is a web-service that is useful for searching for different organic reactions. ReactSearch is a growing project, currently under heavy late-night development, and it's due to be presented to the public in several weeks. Before that, our team has a lot of stuff to do, like writing a nice and neat Readme.md file :) Follow the news!
